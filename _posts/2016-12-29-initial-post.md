This is the initial post to my blog **Hilbert Spaces**

Writing for me is a painfully slow process, because I constantly feel the need to edit what I have written. I also dread that I will not have anything interesting to say, so why did I create this blog?

I want to change that, because I feel writing is a skill I want to improve. So I am going to force myself to write short blog posts regularly, and limiting myself to spending 30 minutes on their composition, so it won't become a tedious chore.

I chose the name **Hilbert Spaces** for this blog because I think that it adequately describes the range of topics I want to cover. [*Hilbert Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space) is an infinite-dimensional analog of Euclidean space, and they are often used in Physics.
