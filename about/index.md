I was pursuing a PhD in Astronomy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. I have yet to submit my thesis, but hopefully that will change soon.

I met my wife while we were both pursuing our MSc in Astronomy at St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. We got married in 2009, and we are now living in Kitchener, Ontario with our cat Shila.

I like to solve math and physics problems, usually by writing some code to either iterate or search for solutions. I have also started to use *Machine Learning* techniques to solve interesting problems.

I like to create video games, particularly rogue-like games.

I like to cooking and learning new recipes and ideas.

I also like making mead. Not only is it fun to make and share, but I love experimenting with different combinations of honey, fruit and spices to achieve unique flavour combinations.
