Here is a little information about myself.

I was born in Richmond Hill, Ontario and I was raised in Oak Ridges, Ontario.

I received my H.BSc in Astrophysics from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) in Toronto, Ontario. then I received my MSc in Astronomy from [St. Mary's University](https://www.smu.ca) in Halfax, Nova Scotia. I began my PhD in Astronomy at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca) in Kingston, Ontario. I have yet to submit my thesis, but I hope to do that soon.

I met my wife while we were both pursuing our MSc in Astronomy at St. Mary's University. We got married in 2009, and we are now living in Kitchener, Ontario with our cat.

I like to solve math and physics problems, usually by writing some code to either iterate or search for solutions. I have also started to use *Machine Learning* techniques to solve interesting problems.

I like to create video games, particularly [rogue-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) games.

I like cooking, particularly learning new recipes and techniques.

I like reading books and watching movies from the science fiction or fantasy genre, but I am not averse to expanding my horizons.

I also like making [mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead). Not only is it delicious, but I love experimenting with different types of honey, fruit and spices to achieve unique flavours.
